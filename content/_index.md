Welcome to the Ori and the Will of the Wisps Randomizer wiki!

It includes lots of information to help install this mod, understand the options for seed generation and learn
about all the new things this mod adds.

The tutorials explain movement techs and other knowledge that is useful to progress in the game. They can also be of use in the vanilla game.

If something is unclear or you need further help, don't hesitate to ask on Discord. Either the [Ori Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SUS57PWWnA) or the [Randomizer Development Discord](https://discord.gg/sfUr8ra5P7).
