When using energy weapons, Ori makes a little hop which can be used in order to get just a little bit more air time or reach higher up platforms.

Sentry and Flash have really close properties but you can use 3 sentries at the same time which is really helpful for horizontal movement while Flash have the benefit of costing less energy.

Blaze can be used an infinite amount of time and let you go a little bit further horizontally. The extra height is pretty irrelevant in most cases because you can't wall jump right after using Blaze.

Shuriken gives a lot of horizontal momentum as well as a really short hop.

Spear gives you a lot of verticality, especially when [combined with a jump](/tutorials/movement/extending-momentum-spear#jumps).

Bow also gives you a minor horizontal boost.
