It is possible to extend the momentum you get from some movement options with Spear by using it right after your movement option, letting you travel more distance than usual.

## Bash

If you use Spear right after releasing a Bash, you will go much further than usual.

## Jumps

Likewise, if you use Spear right after a jump you will go a little higher than usual. It is also possible to extend your double jump by using your double jump and Spear right after. 

When you want to extend a grounded jump then a double jump right after, it's important to keep in mind that you can't throw another Spear right after the first one so you need to wait a bit after the first extended jump before extending your double jump.

When extending a grounded jump, you will also be able to perform a [Spear Jump](/tutorials/movement/spear-jumps) in order to get a little more height. This jump is also very usefull if you want to await the end of the Spear input lock in order to extend a double jump right after.
